anc cr <name> [<path> [--mode <mode>] [--blank] ...]

Create a structured JSON representation of files and directories for later recreation.

If no <path> is provided, the entire current working directory will be used as the base,
and all its contents will be included recursively.

Examples:
  anc cr myenv
    → Includes all files and directories under the current working directory (not the "." string)

  anc cr myenv .
    → Includes the current directory explicitly as a relative path ("./"), will appear in anchor as "~/.../."

  anc cr conf /etc/sysctl.conf --mode regex ~/.bashrc --mode append
    → Applies different modes to each file

  anc cr skeleton env/ --blank
    → Stores directory metadata only, without content

  anc cr multi docker-compose.yml --blank scripts/start.sh --mode prepend /etc/sysctl.conf --mode regex
    → Combines multiple files and modes in one anchor

  # After creation, you can edit the anchor to define regex logic:
  #   "regex": "^net\\.ipv4\\.ip_forward\\s*=.*",
  #   "content": "net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1"

Options:
  --mode <value>     Applies to the previous path:
                      replace   (default) overwrite file content
                      append    add content to the end
                      prepend   insert content at the beginning
                      regex     match lines using regex (requires submode)
  --blank            Store empty content for the previous path

Notes:
  - Each --mode or --blank applies to the path that precedes it.
  - If --mode regex is used, a regex and submode structure is initialized.
  - If no path is given, the anchor includes everything under the current working directory.
  - Anchors are stored as JSON in $ANCHOR_DIR (default: ./data).
  - To recreate the content later, use: anc rc <name>
