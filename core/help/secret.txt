anc ref <subcommand> <id (name)>

Manage encrypted secrets stored in the remote anchor server.

Subcommands:
  ls                  List available secrets (IDs and descriptions)
  get <id>            Retrieve secret value as plaintext (if allowed)
  pull <id>           Download full secret metadata as JSON into ~/.anchors/ref/
  update <id>         Update description, users, groups, or secret value
  push <id>           Create a new secret interactively if it doesn’t exist

Examples:
  anc ref ls
    → Lists all secrets visible to you based on your token's groups or user

  anc ref get db-pass
    → Returns the plaintext value of the secret "db-pass" if permitted

  anc ref pull db-pass
    → Saves full JSON for "db-pass" to ~/.anchors/ref/db-pass.json

  anc ref update db-pass
    → Starts an interactive update flow for the secret

  anc ref push api-key
    → Creates a new secret on the server if it doesn’t exist yet



Behavior:
  - Secrets are encrypted using AES-256-GCM on the server
  - Only users or groups with explicit permissions can view or modify them
  - Creator can restrict updates to themselves only via allow_group_edit = false
  - No plaintext is ever stored in the database

Notes:
  - Uses the server configured via `anc server url` and authenticated with `anc server auth`
  - Secrets are not stored locally unless you explicitly pull them with `pull`
