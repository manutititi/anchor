anc push <name>
anc push -f <key=value>

Upload one or more anchor files to the configured remote server.

Examples:
  anc push my-anchor
    → Uploads '~/.anchors/data/my-anchor.json' to the server

  anc push -f env=prod
    → Uploads all anchors with metadata 'env=prod' after confirmation

Options:
  -f, --filter key=value   Filter anchors by metadata (e.g. project=demo)

Behavior:
  - Pushes anchor(s) to the server defined in 'server/info.json'
  - Requires prior authentication via `anc server auth`
  - Uploads anchor JSON as-is using HTTP POST
  - Shows confirmation prompt before batch upload

Notes:
  - Anchors are loaded from $ANCHOR_DIR (default: ~/.anchors/data/)
  - Any upload failure will show the status code and server response
  - Supports both single-name and multi-anchor workflows
