anc server <subcommand> [args...]

Interact with the configured remote Anchor server (authentication, status, and anchor management).

Examples:
  anc server auth -u john -p secret
    → Authenticate against the server using LDAP credentials

  anc server url http://localhost:17017
    → Set the server URL for anchor operations

  anc server ls
    → List all anchors visible to the current user

  anc server ls -f "env=prod AND type=url"
    → Filter server anchors using metadata expression

  anc server status
    → Check if the remote server is online and reachable

Options:
  -u, --username USERNAME     LDAP username (used with `auth`)
  -p, --password PASSWORD     LDAP password (used with `auth`)
  -f, --filter EXPR           Filter anchors on server (used with `ls`)
  value                       Value for subcommands like `url` (e.g., URL string)

Behavior:
  - `auth` stores a token locally for authenticated API requests
  - `url` updates the remote server endpoint in 'server/info.json'
  - `ls` supports metadata filtering with AND/OR/NOT operators
  - `status` verifies connectivity and token validity

Notes:
  - All server state is stored in ~/.anchors/server/info.json
  - Required for operations like `push`, `pull`, and remote filtering
